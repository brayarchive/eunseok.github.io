        <section class="post-content">
            <p>When <a href="http://dada.theblogbowl.in">Shaumik</a> told me about this <a href="http://theblogbowl.in/contests/contest/the-elegant-world-wide-web/view/">contest</a> on his new <a href="http://theblogbowl.in">blog directory site</a>, I had to pick my favorite site to write about.</p>

<p>Considering I spend most of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness">wakeful state</a> online jumping from site to site, this was not an easy task. With a few new tabs on screen, I watched my fingers dance over the keyboard almost involuntarily, giving me a list of sites I visit often:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a></li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mail.google.com">GMail</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com">Github</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are great sites, some give me information, some help me connect, some learn and some are just so <a href="http://dropbox.com">beautifully designed</a>. But there was a recent addition to the above <em>hall of fame</em> which changed the way I saw websites altogether.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/reddit_logo.png" alt="Reddit logo"></p>

<p>It's not the most pretty site but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People are more than just the way they look.”
         ― Madeleine L'Engle, A Wrinkle in Time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can talk about how <strong><em><a href="http://www.reddit.com/about">Reddit</a></em></strong> has information about everything <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/">music</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/">sports</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology">futurology</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">programming</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism">minimalism</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive">explainlikeimfive</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes">calvinandhobbes</a>, just everything!</p>

<p>Or why it so fun, the sarcastic comments, hosts exciting <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mj1yl/amaa_ask_madonna_almost_anything">AskMeAnythings</a>, has an overall great <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/reddit-2012-7/">community</a>.</p>

<p>But that is not what makes it exceptional.</p>

<p><em>It's greatness lies in it's soul.</em></p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/reddit_alien.jpg" alt="Reddit has a heart"></p>

<p>In a world where a significant amount of people are on the internet, most sites just want to make money out of you. If you don't want to pay for a site, they'll copy your contacts, sell your information, sell you!</p>

<p>But reddit was different. Let me show you how:</p>

<ul>
<li>The frickin' <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1sndxe/weve_rewritten_our_user_agreement_come_check_it/cdzaf2a">CEO explains users</a> the change in user agreement in as simple words as possible! I've never ever seen in all of my virtual life, the <strong>CEO</strong> of a company explain the legal document people agree to without it even looking at it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/yishan_wong.jpg" alt="Yishan Wong">
<em>Yishan Wong, Reddit CEO</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Sub reddits like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/yishansucks">/r/yishansucks</a> that make fun of the CEO exist on the site and he loves it. He <a href="https://www.quora.com/Trolling/Was-Yishan-Wong-just-trolling-Reddit-when-he-posted-a-9GAG-repost-of-Reddit-material/answer/Yishan-Wong">promotes</a> it as well!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/wong2.png" alt="Trolling Yishan Wong">
<em>Trolling Wong</em></p>

<ul>
<li>When sites like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/245058342280723">Facebook</a> force people use their real names, reddit doesn't mind. Anonymous and throw away accounts are common, especially when people want to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1unchy/redditors_who_have_undergone_sexual_reassignment/cejy0x1">respond candidly</a> but do not want to reveal their identities.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/Oscar_Wilde_V_for_Vendetta.jpg" alt="The truth"></p>

<ul>
<li>They <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html">open sourced</a> their entire code in 2008! Now the world not just contributes to the site, they can contribute to the code running it as well.</li>
</ul>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uo4O4T-7BiE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<ul>
<li>Instead of selling their user's data, they chose to look for alternate methods of revenue generation, like reddit gold and reddit gifts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/gold/about">Reddit Gold</a></strong> is a premium membership program which offers simple benefits like highlighted comments and special offers from other companies. In addition to buying gold for yourself, you can <em>gift gold</em> to authors of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/gilded">comments</a> you like. In fact, gilded comments got viral and <em>more people gift gold to strangers than buying for themselves making the world a happier place :)</em></p>

<p>Buying this gold, people also support the site they love and spend time on.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/goldvertisement_v2_sm__1_.png" alt="Daily Gold"></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://redditgifts.com/about/">Reddit Gifts</a></strong> is a massive online gifts exchange marketplace. They connect internet stranger friends dozens of times a year sending out gifts around the world.</p>

<p>They've been setting and breaking their own Guiness records of largest gift exchange programs since 2011. Even Bill Gates participated this year!</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2014/10/bill_gates_2_2771669b.jpg" alt="Mr. Gates and his secret Santa"></p>

<p><em>Bill Gates and his secret Santa</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Lastly, reddit has had some great people:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian">Alexis Ohanian</a>, one of the founders actively campained against internet censorshop laws in US. He helped organize protests against SOPA/PIPA. He also wrote a <a href="http://withouttheirpermission.com/about-the-book">book</a> about his journey and how you can harness the power of the web for good.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, <a href="http://aaronswartzthedocumentary.com/">internet's own child</a> died fighting for an open world. He was an amazing programmer, contributed to the RSS spec, was a notable wikipedia contributer and wrote a python web framework web.py. He joined forces of his startup <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/infogami.html">infogami with reddit</a> becoming a part of the reddit team.</p>

<hr>

<p>They have proved that a huge site can function without being evil. <strong><em>Their mission is to bring more happiness to the world</em></strong> and that is what makes them amazing.</p>

<p>Some more goodness:</p>
